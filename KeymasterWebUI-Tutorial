# MDIP Keymaster WebUI Tutorial

This document contains basic instructions to familiarize the reader with the use of MDIP's Keymaster WebUI. 

The Keymaster WebUI is a client interface to the MDIP Keymaster Library, available in the "kc" (kay-cee) release. The WebUI is not intended to be a commercial wallet; it is a reference implementation of an MDIP wallet offering a web (React) user interface to the MDIP Keymaster library. Wallet creation and MDIP key operations are performed client-side. The server-side is running an MDIP Gatekeeper server, which exposes the Keymaster WebUI server components on port 4224. 

An online version of the MDIP Keymaster WebUI is available here: https://mdip.yourself.dev/
